# Don't Squish the Turtle
Cross the road carefully and avoid squishing the turtle in this game.


## Setup
Clone this repository to a local directory. Refer to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more guidance.

Next, you should install the package neccessary to run **main.py**: *turtle, random,* and *time*. You can install these using **pip**:
```
- pip install turtle
```
```
- pip install random
```
```
- pip install time
```

Now your setup is complete!

# Running the Code
To run the code, run **main.py**. This will open up the turtle window and display the game graphics.

You can only move the turtle forward. You can do it by clicking/pressing the "up arrow" key.

That is all there is to turtle road crossing.
